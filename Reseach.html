        HTTP
    </summary>
    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is a protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML, between a client and a server. HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.

Here are some key points about HTTP:

Request/Response Model: HTTP works on a request-response model. A client (usually a web browser) sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with the requested resource or an error message.

Stateless Protocol: HTTP is stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server is independent. The server does not retain information about previous requests. This is why cookies, sessions, and tokens are often used to manage state across multiple requests.

Methods: HTTP defines several methods, the most common of which are:

GET: Requests data from a specified resource.
POST: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.
PUT: Updates a current resource with new data.
DELETE: Deletes a specified resource.
HEAD: Similar to GET, but only requests the headers without the body.
HTTP Versions: There are several versions of HTTP:

HTTP/1.0: The first version, introduced in 1996.
HTTP/1.1: Introduced in 1997,

        Canvas
    </summary>
    The canvas element in HTML is used to draw graphics on a web page. It provides an area that can be dynamically generated using JavaScript, allowing for the creation of 2D shapes, images, text, and animations. ### Basic Example html canvas id="myCanvas" width="400" height="400" style="border:1px solid #000000;"> Your browser does not support the HTML canvas tag.  var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas"); var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d"); ctx.fillStyle = "#FF0000"; ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 150, 75); script>  ### Key Points: 1. *ID and Attributes: The id, width, and height attributes define the canvas element's properties. The width and height set the size, while the id is used to access it via JavaScript. 2. **getContext() Method: This method returns a rendering context. The most common context type is "2d". 3. **Drawing Shapes*: The ctx object allows you to draw shapes like rectangles, circles, and paths, apply colors, and even use images. ### Common Methods: - fillRect(x, y, width, height): Draws a filled rectangle. - strokeRect(x, y, width, height): Draws a rectangle outline. - clearRect(x, y, width, height): Clears a section of the canvas. - beginPath(), moveTo(x, y), lineTo(x, y): Used for drawing lines. - arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle): Draws an arc (or circle). ### Uses: - Game development. - Data visualization. - Image manipulation. - Custom animations. The element is versatile and can be used wherever dynamic rendering of graphics is needed
